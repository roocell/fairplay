# this is a list of players you want to keep together on shifts
# typically it's a group of players that compliment each other and are well balanced
# this will give your shift a strong foundation

# the number of list here are limited to the number of players on your entire team
# for example
# if you have 15 players and an 8-shift game, there's no point in adding more than 3 strong lines
# because under fairplay rules no player can get more than 3 shifts

# list the strong lines in order of strength
# because the algorithm will adjust the number of shifts
# based on this order
# this is the order in which you'll decide which lines
# end up with more shifts
